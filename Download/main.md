# YouTube Video Downloader

## Introduction
This is a simple YouTube video downloader script written in Python. It utilizes the `pytube` library to interact with the YouTube API and download videos. Additionally, it employs the `tqdm` library to display a progress bar during the download process.

## Why pytube?
This script uses the `pytube` library because it was not possible to download videos directly using the official YouTube API. `pytube` provides an easy-to-use interface for downloading YouTube videos programmatically.
